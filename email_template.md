Hi {name},

This is just a quick reminder about the study today ({date}) at {time}. Please arrive on time. If you are more than 10 minutes late, you may be assigned as a no-show.

__IMPORTANT__: Please review the guidelines below regarding _makeup_ and _glasses_.

__Eye Makeup__: Please avoid heavy eye makeup on the day of the experiment. This includes thick eyeliner, heavy mascara, glittery or shimmery eyeshadows, and false eyelashes. Understanding that you may be coming directly from other commitments, we will provide makeup removal facilities and products in the lab. This will allow you to participate if you are wearing makeup upon arrival.

__Glasses__: Unfortunately, the eye tracker does not work with most glasses. Therefore, you cannot participate in the experiment if you need to wear glasses to have normal or near-normal vision. Non-tinted contact lenses are absolutely fine.

__Location__: The study is being run in Meyer 566. If you take one of the main elevators, you take a right out of the elevator, then your first right, you'll walk down a hallway and up some stairs, and then when you hit the end of the hallway, 566 will be directly to your left. If you instead take the side elevator, you'll come out into a waiting area with seats. Then, the experiment will be down the hall to your left.

Thanks for participating!

Fred
