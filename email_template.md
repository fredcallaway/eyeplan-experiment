Hi {name},

This is just a quick reminder that you're signed up for an eye-tracking study on {date} at {time}. 

<!-- Please plan to arrive five minutes early because we are running on a tight schedule. If you are more than five minutes late, you will most likely not be able to complete the study and you will not get credit. If you know you are running late, send me an email and I will let you know if you can start the study late (depending on the schedule). -->

__Eye Makeup__: Please avoid heavy eye makeup on the day of the experiment. This includes thick eyeliner, heavy mascara, glittery or shimmery eyeshadows, and false eyelashes. 

__Glasses__: The eye tracker usually does not work with glasses. If you have contacts, please wear them instead.

__Location__: The study is being run in Meyer 861. When you enter the building, take the **side elevator**, which is on your right as you enter (not the two main elevators that are right in front). When you get out on the **eigth floor**, you will see **red benches** right in front of you. That's where we will meet you.

__When you arrive__: If there isn't someone waiting for you, please send me a text (510-225-8450) or email (fredcallaway@gmail.com).

__Be on time!__ If you're running late, please let us know as soon as possible. If you're more than five minutes late and haven't contacted us, we may mark you as a no-show.

Thanks for participating!

Fred
